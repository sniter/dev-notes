Main Concept

<pre>

- Traversable
    - Adding elements (++)
    - Map functions (map,flatMap,collect)
    - Conversions (toArray,toList,...)
    - Copy operations (copyToBuffer,copyToArray)
    - Size info (isEmpty, nonEmpty, size, hasDefiniteSize)
    - Element retrieval (head,last,headOption,lastOption,...)
    - Subcollection (tail,init,slice,take, drop ...)
    - Subdivision (splitAt, span, partition, groupBy)
    - Element tests (exists, forall, count)
    - Folds
    - Specific folds (sum,product, min, max)
    - String operations (mkString, addString, stringPrefix)
    - View
- Iterable (in terms of an abstract method - iterator, which yields the collection elements one by one)
    - iterators (iterator,grouped,sliding)
    - Subcollection (takeRight,dropRight)
    - Zippers (zip,zipAll)
    - Comparison (sameElements)
    - has state
- Sequence (Seq)
    - Kind of Iterable that has a length and whose elementes have fixed index positions, starting from 0
    - Linear Sequence - has efficient head and tail operations
        - immutable.List
        - immutable.Stream
    - Indexed Sequence - has efficient apply and length operations
        - Array
        - mutable.ArrayBuffer
    - Vector - compromise between Linear Seq and Indexed Set
    - Buffers - mutable sequences, allow update, insert new one, remove. ArrayBuffer can be easily converted to Array
- Set
    - Kind of Iterable that has no dublicate elements
    - Mutable uses hashtable to store elements
    - Immutable sets use hash tries, more compact and efficient
    - SortedSet - produces its element in given ordering. TreeSet uses red-black tree implementation to maintain ordering and keep balanced
    - BitSet are sets of non-negative integer elements that are implemented in one or more words of packed bits. More compact then another sets, operations like membership tests are extremely efficient
- Map
    - Iteralble  consisitng of pairs Key - Value
    - Lookup operations (apply,get,getOrElse,contains,isDefinedAt)
    - Additions and Updates
    - Removals
    - Subcollection producers (keys, keySet, keysIterator,...)
    - Transformations (filterKeys,mapValues)
    - SyncronizedMap - trait that can be mixed in in whatever particular map implementation you desire in order to receive thread-safe mutable Map
- Hash Tables
    - stores its elements in an underlying array, placing each item at position in array determined by hash code of that item
    - Adding element with constant time
    - Efficient while hash codes have good distribution
- Hash Tries
    - have nice balance between fast lookups and effitional insertions and deletions
    - In Scala default implementations of immutable maps and sets
    - In scala Sets and Maps with 1 to 4 elements are stored as single objects that just contain the elements as fields
    - Empty immutable Set/Map is a single object - no need to dublicate storage
- Red black Trees
    - Form of balanced tree where some nodes designated "red" and athers - "black"
    - TreeSet, TreeMap provided by it
- Array
    - can be generic, Array[T] is absent in java, that is why it is represented as byte[]. or, short[], etc...
    - generic arrays in 3-4 times slower
    - compatible with sequences via implicit conversion
- View
    - have perfomance issues at small data
    - evaluation can be very confusind if the delayed operation have side effect

Immutable

- Traversable
    - Iterable
        - Set
            - SortedSet
                - TreeSet - Red-Black Tree
            - HashSet
            - BitSet
                - uses array of 64-bit Long to store non-negative integers
                - testing inclusion takes constant time
                - Adding an item takes time proportional to number of Longs
            - ListSet
        - Map
            - SortedMap
                - TreeMap - Red-Black Tree
            - HashMap
            - ListMap
                - represents map as linked list of key-value pairs
                - rare used
                - operations on list map have to iterate entire list, take linear time
                - may be used if first elements used more often
        - Seq
            - IndexedSeq
                - Vector
                    - very  when the algorythm processing the is careful to only process their heads - in constant time
                    - Effecient for random access in constant time, but slower than for head.
                    - Tree with high branching factor
                - NumericRange
                - Range
                    - represented in constant space, because can be defined by 3 numbers: start,end,step. most operations extrmely fast
                - Array
                - String
            - LinearSeq
                - List - constant-time for head,tail,add element to the front of list
                - Stream - elements computed lazily, can be infinite
                - Queue - FIFO
                - Stack - LIFO
